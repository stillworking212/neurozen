          The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection
          practices of <b>NeuroZen</b> (“we” or “us”). It outlines the types of
          information we gather about you while you use our website (the “Site”)
          and the ways in which we use this information. This Privacy Policy,
          including our children’s privacy statement, does not apply to
          information you may provide offline (e.g., at live events, via phone,
          or through mail).
        </p>

        <p>
          Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the
          Site, you agree that your use of the Site, and any dispute over
          privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the web evolves,
          we may need to change this policy from time to time. If we make
          changes, we will post the updated policy on this page and update the
          Effective Date above. By continuing to use the Site after changes are
          posted, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[var(--clr-primary)]">
          How We Collect and Use Information
        </h2>
        <p>
          We may collect and store personal or other information that you
          voluntarily supply online while using the Site (e.g., forms,
          registrations, purchases, emails). The Site contacts individuals who
          specifically request that we do so or who have signed up to receive
          our messaging, attended our events, or purchased our products. During
          registration or purchase, we may collect your name and email (for
          opt-ins), and your name, postal address, and payment details (for
          purchases). All such information is provided by you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also collect and store information generated automatically as you
          navigate the Site. For example, we may collect information about your
          device and connection to the Internet to improve delivery of pages and
          measure traffic. We may use “cookies” to enhance your experience,
          remember preferences, deliver advertising, identify unique visitors,
          and track trends. We may also use web beacons (transparent GIFs) to
          access cookies and count users who visit the Site or open HTML emails.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use collected information to customize Site features and
          advertising; to make offers available via email, direct mail, or
          otherwise; and we may provide your information to third parties (e.g.,
          service providers, contractors, publishers, advertisers) for these
          purposes. Unless you instruct us otherwise via the process described
          below, we reserve the right to use—and disclose to third
          parties—information collected from and about you while using the Site
          to provide information about products and services. If you do not wish
          your information to be used for these purposes, email us at
          <a class="link" href="mailto:support@neurozen.com"
            >support@neurozen.com</a
          >
          requesting removal from such lists.
        </p>
        <p class="note border border-[var(--clr-secondary-dark)] rounded p-4">
          Keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make personal information
          available for viewing by third parties online (e.g., message boards,
          blogs, emails, chat areas), that information can be seen, collected,
          and used by others. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized
          third-party use of such information.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[var(--clr-primary)]">
          Third-Party Advertising & Links
        </h2>
        <p>
          Some third-party advertisers/ad servers that place and present
          advertising on the Site may collect information via cookies, web
          beacons, or similar technologies. Their collection and use of
          information is governed by their respective privacy policies, not this
          policy. The Site also includes links to other websites and provides
          access to products/services offered by third parties, whose privacy
          policies we do not control. When you access another website or
          purchase third-party products/services through the Site, use of your
          information is governed by that third party’s policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may make some content, products, and services available through
          cooperative relationships with provider partners (their brands may
          appear on pages). We may share with those partners any information you
          provide or that is collected on such pages. In some cases, the partner
          may collect information directly; their policy will apply in those
          cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may release information when appropriate to comply with law,
          protect rights, property, or safety of Site users or the public, or in
          connection with corporate transactions (e.g., sale of assets, mergers,
          acquisitions), where user information may be among transferred assets.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[var(--clr-primary)]">
          Google Analytics
        </h2>
        <p>
          We use Google Analytics Advertiser Features to optimize our business,
          which may include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc">
          <li>Remarketing with Google Analytics</li>
          <li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
          <li>Google Ads/DoubleClick integrations</li>
          <li>Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By enabling these features, we disclose that we and third-party
          vendors use first-party identifiers (e.g., Google Analytics cookies)
          and third-party identifiers (e.g., DoubleClick cookies) together to
          gather data about your activities on our Site. Among other uses, this
          allows us to contact you if you begin to fill out checkout but abandon
          before completion (e.g., reminder emails). “Remarketing” enables us to
          reach previous visitors with relevant messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies via Google’s Ad Settings
          and/or opt out of third-party vendors’ cookies via the
          <a class="link" href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/"

          </li>
          <li>
            We do not use Facebook advertising data for purposes beyond
            aggregate/anonymous analysis of campaign performance (unless
            authorized by Facebook).
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not use Facebook advertising data (including targeting

            identifiers.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not transfer Facebook advertising data (including

            brokers, or other monetization services.

        <ul class="list-disc">
          <li>
            This Site is not directed to children under 13, and we do not
            knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. We
            screen where appropriate to prevent such collection. If we become
            aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from
            a child under 13, we will delete it. If our practices change, we
            will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because we do not collect personal information from children under

            parties.
