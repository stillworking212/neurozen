        <p>
          Please allow <b>1–2 business days</b> for order processing before
          shipment. During holidays, processing may experience delays.
        </p>

          (Note: U.S. addresses are verified through USPS. If you are unsure of

          Domestic Delivery Time — Standard Shipping
        </h2>
        <p>
          Time in transit depends on the shipping method selected. Transit time
          does not include weekends or holidays. All delivery times are
          estimates. NeuroZen is not responsible for delays due to events beyond
          our control, including shortages of materials, labor strikes,
          transportation failures, or acts of nature.

          Refused, Lost, Stolen, or Delayed Packages
        </h2>
        <p>
          If a package is refused, applicable shipping/handling fees may be
          deducted from any refund and processing will begin only after the
          package is returned and reviewed by our team.
        </p>
        <p>
          We primarily use national carriers (e.g., USPS/UPS). Replacement of
          <b>lost or stolen</b> packages is not guaranteed. For delays or issues
          with delivery, please contact

          the carrier.

        <p>
          (Note: On rare occasions, international shipments can take 4–6 weeks;
          in severe cases, 8–12 weeks. NeuroZen is not responsible for delays
          caused by destination-country customs clearance. Shipping to certain
          countries may require additional fees due to geography.)

          Cancel Order
        </h2>
        <p>
          Orders are sent to fulfillment shortly after placement. If you contact
          us within <b>24 hours</b> of purchase, we will attempt to cancel. If
          the order has been processed or shipped, we cannot cancel it. You may
          refuse delivery and immediately notify
          <a
            class="underline text-[var(--clr-primary)]"
            href="mailto:support@neurozen.com"
            >support@neurozen.com</a

          we can verify. Refunds are issued after the package is received and
          reviewed.

          Wrong Address Disclaimer
        </h2>
        <p>
          Please ensure your address is correct at checkout. Due to strict
          shipping schedules, address changes are not guaranteed. NeuroZen is not
          responsible for orders shipped to an address entered incorrectly by
          the buyer. If the order has shipped, we must wait to see if it is
          returned to us; if returned, we can re-ship to a corrected address
          (additional postage may apply) or issue a refund.
        </p>

          Delivery of Items
        </h2>
        <p>
          If tracking states “Delivered” to your address, NeuroZen does not issue
          refunds for non-receipt claims. Please contact the designated carrier
          (e.g., USPS/UPS) for assistance in locating the package.

          Returns
        </h2>
        <p>
          To obtain a <b>full refund</b> under our
          <b>60-day satisfaction guarantee</b>, you must return all bottles
          included in your order (empty, full, or partially full — including any
          bonus/free bottles) within <b>sixty (60) days</b> of the original
          purchase date. Include a note inside the package with:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Your Order ID (found on your receipt)</li>
          <li>

            received

          <li>Your email address and phone number</li>
          <li>The original packing slip (if available)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> Failure to return all bottles may result in a partial
          refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for return shipping. Once our fulfillment center
          receives and verifies your return, a refund will be issued to the
          original method of payment. Depending on your bank, it may take
          <b>3–5 business days</b> to appear on your statement.
